Hey Chris. I'm not used to commenting, but I wanted to tell you that safely endangered has been one of my favorite webcomics for the last few years. It's sad to say goodbye to title guy, but I hope you find success in whatever you do next. You've brought many smiles to this corner of the internet and you should feel proud! Thank you for everything!
