Fun fact, the Bermuda Triangle was never haunted cursed, or even had an excess of missing ships in that area, the myth came because to be because a lot of people happened to be sailing in that area. If you look at the rates of the missing ships to ships traveling in a space there's nothing special about the triangle

Still loving that the reason we never hear about it anymore was a BUNCH of studies were done, and not just recently, that all concluded the area is generally no more or less dangerous than any other part of the ocean and that most accounts were either wrong, hyperbole, or outright made up.

An aurora borealis, at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely in your evil lair? Edit: to whoever disliked all the comments, I have liked them all at the moment this was edited.
