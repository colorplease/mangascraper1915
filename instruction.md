### Images Not Downloading Correctly

## Advanced Tips

### Increasing Download Speed
- The application uses 30 parallel threads by default
- If you have a fast internet connection, you can modify this in the code:
  1. Open `manga_scraper_gui.py` in a text editor
  2. Find the line `self.max_workers = 30` in the MangaScraper class
  3. Change to a higher number (e.g., 40-50) if you have fast internet
  4. Save and restart the application

### Conserving Memory
- For computers with limited RAM, reduce the number of parallel threads:
  1. Find the line `self.max_workers = 30` in the code
  2. Change to a lower number (e.g., 10-15)
  3. Save and restart the application
