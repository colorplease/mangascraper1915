I totally get now why Isabella was so slappy with the staff and I hope she gives Damian a piece of her palm too while she‚Äôs at it

I love how the brother was trying to get Isabelle to turn against her sister and she was like "Who the crap cares about blood?! My sister is being abused and mistreated! Do something!"

I guess, she is the real heir and the father is just a relative.

Ilegitimate or not... its never the child's fault. Its not fair to treat them differently because of simply that. It does not make them any less worthy as a human being

nothing pisses me off more than stupid idiots blaming the illegitimate child. blame one of your parents for cheating not the poor child born from it

So what? They were raised like siblings, even strangers deserve to be treated like human beings. I hate the brother, may both sisters and Lavender run away together and live a happy life

Shouldve just told damian that the nanny was a thief

Did the trash tell him or did he overhear it? He's obviously known for a very long time.

It‚Äôs interesting that she assumed Isabella knew more than Damien in her first life and it‚Äôs definitely the reverse. Isabella will physically put herself into harm‚Äôs way for her and Damien will physically put her into harm‚Äôs way.
