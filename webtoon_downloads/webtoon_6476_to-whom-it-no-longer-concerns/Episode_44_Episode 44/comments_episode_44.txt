I knew it! He saved her life. And he just keeps saving her! I wonder if she saved him in some way as well to explain why he’s never gotten over her

It's interesting that Ariana didn't get any of her father's traits in terms of personality. Alena sleeps around, or at least flirts around with higher ups just like the dad, and Edward is a cruel person when he's drunk like the dad. Still curious about how their father died though.

Okay so not the time or place but baby Dante and Ari are so cute and I feel so bad for thinking so because of the horror of the memory 😭 well that also certainly explains the previous guy who got ninja stars to the throat

I can understand why she blocked that out. The grandpa’s death was brutal, especially for a little kid to see.
